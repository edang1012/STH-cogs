# STH-cogs
Contains the Red Discord Bot cogs made/used by STH. 
Has a mix of V2/V3 cogs as we work towards a full transistion to V3 

Beta-chan is the bot used to test V3 cogs. This repository is set to 'test' in Beta-chan

Working Cogs:
- seqreact (V3 only): based on smartreact, but allows you to send a sequence of reactions
  - todo: 
    - ~~add listseq command~~
    - add support for phrases
    - make it react to emotes
- saido (~~V2~~ V3 only): works just like mycog, just made into a standalone cog
- ohmy (V3 only): same as said, but you are already dead
- wat (V3 only): fixed to work in V3
- bigmoji (V3 only): flapjacks rewrite of bigmoji

Wishlist: 
- update saido to V3
- make oh my (V3)
- make ayaya react support regex (V3)
