# STH-cogs
Contains the Red Discord Bot cogs made/used by STH. 
Has a mix of V2/V3 cogs as we work towards a full transistion to V3 

Beta-chan is the bot used to test V3 cogs. This repository is set to 'test' in Beta-chan

Working Cogs:
- seqreact (V3 only): based on smartreact, but allows you to send a sequence of reactions
  - todo: 
    - add listseq command
    - add support for phrases
- saido (V2 only): works just like mycog, just made into a standalone cog

Wishlist: 
- update saido to V3
- make oh my (V3)
- make ayaya react support regex (V3)

Current list of (important) cogs used on the STH server: 
- bigmoji (V2)
- downloader (V2)
- insult (V2)
- mycog: for 'sigh' (V2)
